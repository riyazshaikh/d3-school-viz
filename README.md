# school-viz
Data Visualization class project based on data from Research Alliance for NYC Schools. Data is from 2012, and serves primarily to show off D3 visualizations.

# Usage

Click on play button to see the entire sequence. For finer control, use the Previous/Next buttons at the bottom. 

You may hover over any school to see details about it, which includes a sparkline for visualizing patterns over time. Similar functionality if you hover over school district, except the data is now aggregated at district level.

# Modes

School Openings & closings - Yellow indicates newly opened schools. Red indicates newly closed schools. Notice the distribution over time and school districts.

Total Enrollment - Size of circle indicates enrollment level at school. Yellow dots indicate the schools with increasing enrollment.

Average Enrollment per School - Districts are shaded according to the enrollment in that district, relative to others. Hover over the quantile boxes to see which districts fit that quantile.
